# Practical RL

I was done watching course videos. I am now teaching myself to code various RL algorithms under different environments.

Referring multiple online resources for this. Listed below.

I have picked and implemented some of the above codes to understand the programming aspect of RL better. You may follow the links or refer to my implementations.

Good luck learning!
